Hello, my name is Eric Taylor. I am currently enrolled in the UW Full-Stach Web Development Bootcamp. We are scheduled to graduate 06/13/2022!

We are currently learning back-end programming; SQL and Sequalize. 

Prior to this bootcamp, I was the CEO of a sports company, Apollo Academy Basketball, for the past 3 years and previously was the CFO of another sports company, Fenix Basketball, for the 2 years prior to my tenure with Apollo. Before Fenix Basketball, I was also the sports performance and logistics director of City Baseball, which grew to be the largest youth baseball company in the Northwest during my tenure there. 

During my tenure with Apollo, we grew to a multiple six figure company in 2 years while operating with a very regionally based service. I was responsible for collecting and allocating finances across the company, was the primary point of contact for all Apollo clients, and built all websites and technology used within Apollo.
